## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-1: Python-Based Image Generator Architecture

- Context: We need a reliable, maintainable system for generating custom Raspberry Pi images for the W4B edge devices.
- Decision: We will implement a fully Python-based image generator using established libraries for disk image manipulation, templating, and validation.
- Consequences: This approach gives us better maintainability, testing capabilities, error handling, and integration possibilities than a shell script approach. It requires more initial development time but will provide a more robust long-term solution.

### ADR-2: Declarative Configuration with YAML

- Context: We need a flexible, human-readable way to specify image configurations.
- Decision: We will use YAML as the primary configuration format with support for environment variable substitution.
- Consequences: YAML provides good readability and structure while allowing for complex configurations. It's widely used and has good library support. This approach separates configuration from implementation and makes it easier to manage different image variants.

### ADR-3: Multi-Stage Build Pipeline

- Context: Image generation requires several distinct steps that should be clearly separated.
- Decision: We will implement a multi-stage pipeline architecture with clear stage boundaries and state passing.
- Consequences: This approach improves maintainability by isolating concerns and makes it easier to resume from failures. It also enables better testing of individual stages and parallel execution where possible. The downside is slightly more complex architecture and potential overhead.

### ADR-4: Direct Disk Image Manipulation vs. Chroot

- Context: There are multiple approaches to modifying Raspberry Pi images, including mounting/modifying directly or using chroot environments.
- Decision: We will use direct disk image manipulation with loop devices rather than chroot environments.
- Consequences: Direct manipulation gives us more control and doesn't require running within the ARM environment or emulation. It's more efficient but requires careful cleanup of resources. We'll need to implement proper error handling to ensure loop devices are properly detached.

### ADR-5: Comprehensive Validation and Testing

- Context: Generated images need to be reliable and meet all requirements.
- Decision: We will implement a comprehensive validation system that tests images before distribution.
- Consequences: Validation adds an extra step but ensures higher quality and reduces deployment issues. We'll need to develop methods to test images without actual device deployment, potentially using QEMU or similar emulation.

### ADR-6: Extensible Software Installation Framework

- Context: Different hive deployments may need different software packages and configurations.
- Decision: We will create a pluggable software installation framework that allows for easy addition of new packages and configurations.
- Consequences: This approach gives us flexibility for future expansion but requires careful design of the plugin architecture. We'll need to ensure compatibility between software packages and manage dependencies effectively.

### ADR-7: Integration with Hive Configuration Manager

- Context: Image generation needs to be tightly integrated with the hive configuration system.
- Decision: We will create direct integration points with the hive configuration manager to source hive settings, credentials, and requirements.
- Consequences: This integration ensures consistency between hub configurations and edge device deployments. It creates a dependency but simplifies the overall system by avoiding duplicate configuration systems.

### ADR-8: Support for Multiple Raspberry Pi Models

- Context: The W4B platform may deploy on various Raspberry Pi hardware.
- Decision: We will create a hardware abstraction layer that supports multiple Raspberry Pi models and allows for model-specific configurations.
- Consequences: This approach increases flexibility but adds complexity. We'll need to test across multiple hardware platforms and maintain compatibility as new models are released.

### ADR-9: Security-First Approach

- Context: Edge devices need strong security to protect the overall system.
- Decision: We will implement a security-first approach with secure defaults, minimal attack surface, and comprehensive hardening.
- Consequences: This approach improves overall system security but may require more complex setup and potential trade-offs with usability. We'll need to ensure security measures don't interfere with legitimate operations.

### ADR-10: Versioned and Reproducible Builds

- Context: We need to ensure images can be reproduced exactly for debugging and auditing.
- Decision: We will implement versioning and reproducibility features in the build process.
- Consequences: This improves traceability and debugging capabilities but requires careful management of dependencies and build environments. We'll need to implement proper versioning for all components and record all build inputs.
