## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-1: MVP First Approach with Temperature Sensors

- Context: We need to build a comprehensive sensor management system supporting multiple sensor types, but have limited resources.
- Decision: We will implement a complete end-to-end solution focusing only on temperature sensors for the MVP, while creating dummy/mock implementations for other sensor types.
- Consequences: This allows us to deliver a working system quickly while establishing the architecture for future expansion. It delays complete implementation of other sensor types but provides a clear path for adding them later.

### ADR-2: Abstract Sensor Interface with Concrete Implementations

- Context: We need to support multiple sensor types with different hardware interfaces while maintaining consistent collection logic.
- Decision: We will create an abstract SensorBase class that defines a common interface, with concrete implementations for each sensor type.
- Consequences: This enables consistent handling of all sensors and makes it easy to add new sensor types. It slightly increases initial development complexity but greatly improves maintainability and extensibility.

### ADR-3: TimescaleDB for Local Storage

- Context: We need efficient storage for time-series sensor data with good query performance and retention management.
- Decision: We will use TimescaleDB as our local data store for sensor readings.
- Consequences: TimescaleDB provides efficient time-series storage and automatic partitioning. It requires additional system dependencies but offers better performance than standard PostgreSQL or SQLite for our time-series data needs.

### ADR-4: Mock Implementation for Hub Synchronization

- Context: The complete system requires synchronization with a central hub, but this adds complexity for the MVP.
- Decision: We will define a data synchronization interface but implement a no-op mock for the MVP.
- Consequences: This allows us to define the architecture for synchronization without implementing the full complexity. Later, we can replace the mock with a real implementation without changing the rest of the system.

### ADR-5: YAML-Based Configuration

- Context: We need a flexible, human-readable configuration system for the sensor framework.
- Decision: We will use YAML for all configuration, with schema validation and environment variable substitution.
- Consequences: YAML provides good human readability and structured data. It supports comments and is familiar to most users. This approach requires parsing and validation logic but offers good flexibility and maintainability.

### ADR-6: Prometheus for Monitoring

- Context: We need to monitor the health and performance of the sensor management system.
- Decision: We will use Prometheus for metrics collection, even in the MVP with a minimal set of metrics.
- Consequences: This establishes a consistent monitoring approach from the beginning. It adds a small dependency but provides valuable insights into system operation and potential issues.

### ADR-7: Async I/O for Sensor Communication

- Context: Sensor reading operations can block and delay other operations.
- Decision: We will use asynchronous I/O (via asyncio) for sensor communication and data collection.
- Consequences: This allows non-blocking operation and better resource utilization. It adds some complexity to the code but provides better scalability as we add more sensors.
